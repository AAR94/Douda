Douda is a basic snake game built in Java using AWT for graphics and gameplay. The player uses the 'z', 'q', 's', and 'd' keys
to move the snake up, right, down and left around the screen.

The goal is to navigate the snake to collide with food dots scattered around the screen. When the snake eats a food dot, its 
length grows.

The key concepts covered in this snake game include:

  -Object-oriented programming - Creating game objects like the snake segments, food dots, etc..
  
  -Event handling - Detecting keypresses to move the snake.
  
  -AWT graphics - Drawing the game interface and entities.
  
  -Data structures - Using a linked list to represent the snake body.
